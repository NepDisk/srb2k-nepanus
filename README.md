# SRB2Kart: Uranus - Nepanus fork

[SRB2Kart](https://srb2.org/mods/) is a kart racing mod based on the 3D Sonic the Hedgehog fangame [Sonic Robo Blast 2](https://srb2.org/), based on a modified version of [Doom Legacy](http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net/).

## Nepanus Fork
A fork of a fork. This hardcodes many features that I personally enjoy using. btw its pronounced nep-a-nus :^)
